# Shriya's Personal Website
Shriya Nandwani, Fall 2018 VCG Dev. 

Website can be found at shriyanan.github.io; Check it out :)

### Description

My plan is to create a well-designed portfolio website, where all of my projects, my resume, and essentially my professional interests are visible. I've decided to create a website like this as my capstone project because it not ony teaches me some web development, but it also helps me create a something that can be potentially beneficial to me professionally.

### Implementation
**TODO**: Complete this while you're working on your project. Preferably, you're describing what steps you took for different parts of the project.

1. Make homepage: this step was different than I envisioned it to be. At first, I imagined having a website with a navigation bar that linked to several different html files, but after browsing around other portfolio websites, I found myself liking the single page feel. This step ended up with me having one cohesive page with several sections

2. Creating the 1 page layout. I couldn't figure out how to a webpage that was not bound to a specific length when scrolling, so I ended up grabbing an HTML template from online, just so I could incorporate this on my website. 

3. I wanted to add some cool, special effects, so I browsed around on codepen and found some things I liked! It was interesting to integrate this because I had to create a separate class in my html file for them, and change a lot of the css so that it pointed to the right section I was editing. 

4. Finally, when I was done with the design of the website, I updated all my content and information to the website!
