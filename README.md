# Shriya's Personal Website
Shriya Nandwani, Fall 2018 VCG Dev. 

### Description

My plan is to create a well-designed portfolio website, where all of my projects, my resume, and essentially my professional interests are visible. I've decided to create a website like this as my capstone project because it not ony teaches me some web development, but it also helps me create a something that can be potentially beneficial to me professionally.
